# Texas Instruments CC2538

Peripheral Access Crate for the CC2538 using [svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust).
The SVD file are generated from the TIXML files from TI Code Composer Studio using [tixml2svd](https://github.com/dhoove/tixml2svd).

The SVD file contained wrong interrupt numbers, but those are corrected manually.

**This crate is autogenerated and thus can contain bugs from the SVD file.**
